# Manager-Employee Queries in PostgreSQL

This document explains two different SQL approaches to find **managers** (employees who have at least one direct report) along with the number of reports and the average age of their reports.

---

## Table Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR,
    reports_to INT,
    age INT
);
````

**Example Data:**

| employee\_id | name    | reports\_to | age |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- | --- |
| 9            | Hercy   | NULL        | 43  |
| 6            | Alice   | 9           | 41  |
| 4            | Bob     | 9           | 36  |
| 2            | Winston | NULL        | 37  |

## **Approach 1: Using a CTE with Correlated Subqueries**

```sql
WITH EMP_CTE AS (
    SELECT e1.employee_id,
           e1.name,
           ( -- correlated subquery
               SELECT COUNT(employee_id)
               FROM Employees e2
               WHERE e2.reports_to = e1.employee_id
           ) AS reports_count,
           (
               SELECT ROUND(AVG(e2.age))
               FROM Employees e2
               WHERE e2.reports_to = e1.employee_id
           ) AS average_age
    FROM Employees e1
)
SELECT employee_id, name, reports_count, average_age
FROM EMP_CTE
WHERE reports_count >= 1
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

### **How it Works**

* The **outer query** lists all employees.
* The **first correlated subquery** counts how many employees report to the current `e1.employee_id`.
* The **second correlated subquery** calculates the average age of those employees, rounding to the nearest integer.
* The `WHERE reports_count >= 1` filter ensures only managers are included.

## **Approach 2: Using Self JOIN and GROUP BY**

```sql
SELECT
    mgr.employee_id,
    mgr.name,
    COUNT(emp.employee_id) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(emp.age)) AS average_age
FROM employees emp
JOIN employees mgr 
    ON emp.reports_to = mgr.employee_id
GROUP BY mgr.employee_id, mgr.name
ORDER BY mgr.employee_id;
```

### **Step-by-Step Execution**

#### **Step 1: Self JOIN**

```sql
FROM employees emp
JOIN employees mgr ON emp.reports_to = mgr.employee_id
```

* `emp` → subordinates
* `mgr` → managers
* The join matches each subordinate’s `reports_to` with a manager’s `employee_id`.

**Result after JOIN:**

| emp.employee\_id | emp.name | emp.age | emp.reports\_to | mgr.employee\_id | mgr.name | mgr.age | mgr.reports\_to |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 6                | Alice    | 41      | 9               | 9                | Hercy    | 43      | NULL            |
| 4                | Bob      | 36      | 9               | 9                | Hercy    | 43      | NULL            |

---

#### **Step 2: Group by Manager**

```sql
GROUP BY mgr.employee_id, mgr.name
```

* Groups all rows belonging to the same manager.

---

#### **Step 3: Aggregations**

* **`COUNT(emp.employee_id)`** → number of direct reports per manager.
* **`AVG(emp.age)`** → average age of the reports.
* **`ROUND(...)`** → rounds average to nearest integer.

## **Output Example**

For Example Input:

| employee\_id | name  | reports\_to | age |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- | --- |
| 9            | Hercy | NULL        | 43  |
| 6            | Alice | 9           | 41  |
| 4            | Bob   | 9           | 36  |

**Result:**

| employee\_id | name  | reports\_count | average\_age |
| ------------ | ----- | -------------- | ------------ |
| 9            | Hercy | 2              | 39           |

---

## **Performance Notes**

* **Approach 1** (CTE + correlated subqueries) may be slower for large datasets because each correlated subquery is executed per row.
* **Approach 2** (JOIN + GROUP BY) is generally faster since aggregation is done in a single pass after the join.

### **another merged join table example given below**

| emp.employee\_id | emp.name | emp.age | emp.reports\_to | mgr.employee\_id | mgr.name | mgr.age | mgr.reports\_to |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 2                | Bob      | 30      | 1               | 1                | Alice    | 45      | NULL            |
| 3                | Charlie  | 28      | 1               | 1                | Alice    | 45      | NULL            |
| 4                | David    | 26      | 2               | 2                | Bob      | 30      | 1               |
| 5                | Eva      | 29      | 2               | 2                | Bob      | 30      | 1               |
