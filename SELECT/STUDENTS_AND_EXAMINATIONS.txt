STUDENTS AND EXAMINATIONS

ðŸ“Œ Problem Summary:
You are given three tables:
1. Students - Contains student_id and student_name
2. Subjects - Contains subject_name
3. Examinations - Logs which student took which subject's exam (may have duplicates)
Each student from the Students table takes every course from the Subjects table.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Find how many times each student appeared for each subject's exam.
Even if they didn't appear (i.e., count = 0), still show the record.

ðŸ“¥ Sample Input:
Students table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
| 13         | John         |
| 6          | Alex         |
+------------+--------------+
Subjects table:
+--------------+
| subject_name |
+--------------+
| Math         |
| Physics      |
| Programming  |
+--------------+
Examinations table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | subject_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Programming  |
| 2          | Programming  |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Math         |
| 13         | Math         |
| 13         | Programming  |
| 13         | Physics      |
| 2          | Math         |
| 1          | Math         |
+------------+--------------+.

ðŸ“¤ Expected Output:
All (student, subject) pairs with a count of how many times the student appeared.
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+ 0

ðŸ§  How the Query Works:

SELECT
  S.student_id,
  S.student_name,
  SB.subject_name,
  COUNT(E.subject_name) AS attended_exams

FROM Students S
CROSS JOIN Subjects SB
  â†’ This creates every possible combination of student and subject.

LEFT JOIN Examinations E
  ON S.student_id = E.student_id AND SB.subject_name = E.subject_name
  â†’ Brings exam records matching the student and subject.
  â†’ If no match (student didnâ€™t appear), E.subject_name will be NULL.

GROUP BY S.student_id, S.student_name, SB.subject_name
  â†’ Groups the results by each (student, subject) pair.

ORDER BY S.student_id, SB.subject_name
  â†’ Neatly sorts the result.

COUNT(E.subject_name)
  â†’ Counts how many times each student appeared for that subject.
  â†’ Returns 0 if they didnâ€™t appear at all.

âœ… Output: A complete table of every student + every subject + count of exams attended.
